	– Editing/cancelling orders
	– OrderView [from OrderViewModule]
		– OrderSummaryComponent again, with editability



IMMEDIATE TODO LIST

– Phone and browser behaviour


OTHER THINGS TO DO

– Warning message before deleting category (and piece?)
– Move EditButtonsComponent properly inside EditableOrderedListItemComponent, rather than injecting it from outside
	– Take [upVisible] and [downVisible] inputs; give (up), (down) and (delete) events
	– Simplify navigation back to home if selected category is deleted: can be handled by list item, not whole list, which needn't any longer keep track of CategorySelector
– Mass image upload
– Exhibition list
– Registration
– Comments (including for individual pieces/categories?)
– Basket, orders, checkout
	– Staff controls: dispatch etc
– Contact form
– Progress bar for image upload, and for various operations that send email
– Image tickers in category list: respond to adding/changing/deletion of piece images
– Which other tests can use async rather than fakeAsync? Could cut out lots of bulky flushMicrotasks() calls.
– DirectiveTest (subclass of ComponentTest; supply .hostComponent and .directive members)
– Animation/transition troubles in IE
	– Category menu and load screen inexplicably aren't animating like everything else is
– Split utils up between modules


ASSORTED NOTES

– Deal with circular dependency warning
	– How come this particular circle is a problem, but e.g. category.service -> category -> category.service is fine?
– Possible redesign of caching system
	– Rather than calling .cacheLinkedObjects() recursively, find the entire collection of linked objects first, then cache them in one go
– Consider using a Set, instead of a list, for multiple linked objects. They're not kept in any particular order, but must be unique.
– Heaps of benign-but-distracting 404 errors in tests
– StaticFieldComponent template is looking necessarily knotty to avoid whitespace. Any way around this without creating visible space between prefix and field e.g. '£ 150'?
	– Generating subcomponents of StaticFieldComponent dynamically could solve this, and would cut out a lot of repeated code in the template (but be harder to test, as mock components might not be useable)
– Giving PieceNavigatorButtonComponent a direct routerLink to the desired piece would be a more elegant solution than the current one (emitting a click event; navigator itself emits the next piece; router is uninvolved)
– Shroud/dialogue are still 'displayed', though entirely transparent, most of the time; does this affect performance? Try changing if things get slow
– Lots of change detection going on in forms. Would it make a noticeable difference to cache certain values (concerning layout, etc) rather than calculating them on the fly?
– Unit tests for modules
